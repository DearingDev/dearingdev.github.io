I've been meaning to create a blog and document my professional journey in the IT space.  I've been working in IT for approximately 7 years now primarily in helpdesk roles. In that time I've developed a love for end point automation. Some technologies I get to touch on a regular basis are:

- Proxmox
- Ansible
- Git
- PDQ Connect
- Jamf Pro
- PowerShell

I'm looking to eventually land in a more system administration focused role, but for the time being most of the content in this blog will be focused around the tools I work with now. I will also discuss tools I experiment with in my homelab and other fun projects.
