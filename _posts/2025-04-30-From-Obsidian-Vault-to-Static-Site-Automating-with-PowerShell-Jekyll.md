Obsidian is a fantastic tool for note-taking and personal knowledge management. But what about sharing that knowledge? While Obsidian offers publishing option, Iâ€™m going to show you how I use a PowerShell script to synchronize my Obsidian vault to a Jekyll-powered website hosted with GitHub Pages.

## Setting up your environment

### Download Obsidian

Download the latest version of [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) from their website.

### Create a new vault

Create a new vault in your desired location.

### Create new directories in the vault

1. Create a folder named `posts`
2. Create a folder named `assets`
	1. Create a subfolder named `img`
3. Create a folder named `templates`

### Update Obsidian Settings

#### Files and Links

1. Change **New Link Format** to `Absolute path in vault`
2. Uncheck `Use [[Wikilinks]]`
3. Set the **Default ocation for new attachments** to be `In the folder specified below`
	1. Set the **Attachment folder path** to be `assets/img`

Your settings should look something like this:
