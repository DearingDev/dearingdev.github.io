Hey there! I'm a technology enthusiast with a passion for making things work better. For the past 7+ years, I’ve been immersed in the world of IT, building and maintaining systems that are reliable and efficient. I love finding ways to automate tasks (particularly with PowerShell). There's something incredibly satisfying about streamlining processes and creating elegant solutions. 

Beyond the professional world, I’m a big fan of tinkering and learning. I spend a lot of time homelabbing and self-hosting various services, always exploring new technologies and pushing my skills. It's a great way to learn and experiment outside of a traditional work environment.  

Ultimately, I'm driven by a curiosity to learn, solve problems, and build things that are both functional and enjoyable to use. I’m always open to connecting with fellow tech lovers and sharing ideas – feel free to reach out!
